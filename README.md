**State managers comparison**

In this sandbox-project I use different state managers to solve two tasks: manage access to counter number and toggle notification-component.
*State-manage packages*:
1. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)
2. [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html)
3. [Kea](https://kea.js.org/docs/guide/concepts)
